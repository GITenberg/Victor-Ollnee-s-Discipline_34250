description: This 1911 novel features a spiritual medium who sacrifices to make a
  better life for her son, while keeping him ignorant of her profession. When she
  is the subject of a lawsuit in which she must prove her claims, her manifestations
  of supernatural power win her skeptical son over though at a tragic price.
